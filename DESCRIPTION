Description: UpSetToolkit is a tool designed to for handling, manipulating, and visualizing genomic 
data from CHiP-atlas, the Fabian Variant web app, and the MotifBreakR R package.  This R 
scripts in the toolkit clean, manipulate, and integrate SNP data stored in CSV, 
tab-delimited, and BED file formats. The primary goal of UpSetToolkit is to facilitate 
the generation of UpSet plots, providing a visual representation of the intersections and 
relationships within these genomic datasets.
